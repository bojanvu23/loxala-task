# Loxala Task - Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

### 1. Application Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Hosting**: Fly.io
Note: All stack was defined by task, and I just picked Fly.io from list, not used before.

### 2. Key Components

#### API Layer
- RESTful API design with versioning (`/api/v1/`)
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation (Swagger UI)
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Error handling middleware

#### Database Layer
- Schema-based organization (`loxala_task` schema)
- Optimized indexes for search operations
- Automatic timestamp management (created_at, updated_at)
- Array support for ingredients storage

#### Deployment Strategy
- Multi-environment setup (Development/Production)
- Branch-based deployment:
  - `main` → Production
  - `development` → Development
- Automated CI/CD pipeline:
  1. Run tests
  2. Build Docker image
  3. Push to GitHub Container Registry
  4. Deploy to appropriate Fly.io environment
Note: Steps like linters, code quality check would be included in production application

### 3. Security Measures
- Environment-based secrets management
- Database credentials isolation
- HTTPS enforcement
- GitHub token-based authentication
- Secure database connection strings

### 4. Development Workflow
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Automated testing with pytest
- Version control with Git
- Feature branch workflow

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance
Note: Not implemented.


## Posible Improvements

1. **Performance & Infrastructure**
   - Implement caching layer
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Migrate to Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE) for better orchestration
   - Use managed database services (RDS/Azure Database)
   - Implement auto-scaling based on load
   - Use CDN for static content delivery

2. **Security**
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement authentication
   - Introduce code quality and vulnerability checkers

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add logging service
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Set up alerting system

4. **Features**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add image upload support
   - Add FE application

5. **Development**
   - Add more tests
   - Implement feature flags
   - Add development tools and scripts
   - Implement branch protection rules:
     - Require PR reviews before merge
     - Block direct pushes to main/development
     - Require status checks to pass
   - Set up team access controls and permissions
   - Add automated PR templates and guidelines
